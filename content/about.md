Just another rando white dude who does various important things. Or at least that's what I tell myself. I sleep just
fine, why do you ask?

More details available on [my GitHub profile][profile].  The repo for [this site][site-repo] is available there as well.

I also have a [LinkedIn][linkedin] profile, if you prefer.

One damn minute, Admiral! An anomaly has been detected. Who owns all those things? Eh, don't worry your pretty little
head about it.
