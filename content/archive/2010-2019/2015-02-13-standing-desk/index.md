title: Standing Desk
---

As [I stated in an earlier post][1], I've been struggling with back pain for quite a long time.  Last year, I purchased a new mattress from [Verlo][2], and that definitely helped.  But I knew I could do more.  I decided that I needed to figure out a way to try the option of working at a standing desk to see if that helped.

From what I can gather, standing desks are by no means a new idea.  They've been utilized off and on for at least a few hundred years, but I couldn't find any citations to confirm that.  Supposedly, it is a healthy way to work compared to sitting at a desk all day, but that seems to be more supposition than confirmed fact.  Personally, I've seen a few of these in use, and even had a few coworkers who had one.  But, since I had never had a chance to use one myself, I wasn't even sure if I was going to like it or not.  So I knew going in that I needed to have a way to convert back and forth, and I also wanted to keep an eye on the budget.

There are a ton of articles on the Internet proclaiming various "do it yourself" methods of building a standing desk.  Some of the ones I found were quite ingenious, but hardly any of them allowed for the option of converting back and forth.

Searching the web, it was no surprise that I found a ton of different vendors hawking their wares.  The price ranged from as little as $249 to over $3,000 depending on the selected options and gadgets and widgets.  I finally happened upon [Varidesk][3], and decided to purchase their Pro Plus 48 unit.  It was priced at $400, but because it weighs 85 pounds shipped, there was another $110 of shipping tacked on.  This was a bit more expensive from what I had originally wanted to spend, but the mechanical operation coupled with the fact that I could use it with my existing desk was quite tempting.

On Wednesday, I received the behemoth.  I was able to manhandle it up the stairs (they suggested team lift, of course, but I didn't have anybody to give me a hand).  The unit is fully assembled; all you need to do is remove it from the packaging and place it on the desk.  I took a few pictures as I got everything set up; it only took me about 45 minutes to get everything situated and ready to go.

The only concern I have with the desk is that when it's in the standing position, it feels a little wobbly.  I suspect this really isn't an issue with the Varidesk itself, but rather the cheap desk I have it sitting on.  For purposes of style, the desk has only two legs coming up from the floor, mounted on a horizontal crossbar which makes it almost like a wide I-beam from the side (you can see this pretty clearly in the first picture).  So, when the desk is raised, I have to be careful not to lean on it, but that's probably better anyway.

All said and done, I really enjoy using the desk.  I've written this entire article in standing mode, and I can feel it in my legs (which is a good thing).  Standing has also made it easier for me to take short breaks and walk around a bit, or at least has given me the illusion that it's easier.  If I decide to continue using a standing desk, I already am starting to suspect that at some point I will need to make a decision and either replace the cheap desk that I have the Varidesk sitting on, or possibly purchase a more expensive electric standing desk like an [Uplift desk][5].

But I need at least a month before I make a decision either way.
