title: Modern Society, Old Tech

### Society Depends on Old Tech

So much of the technology infrastructure that modern society today currently
depends on was created long before security was even being considered as a primary
concern.  In many cases, how technology is being used now  use is far different
from what was originally envisioned or designed.  While this is great for today's
users, many of the things we have come to depend on have vital flaws that can
be exploited.  What's worse, we know that these exploits exist, but only 
limited progress has been made against the work required to protect these
critical systems that we have come to depend on.

When many of these technologies were first created or developed, the focus was
aimed directly at proving if something could even work.  Of course, this makes
sense as so much of what we take for granted today was the subject of science
fiction not so long ago.

### Development and Consumers

Companies burned large quantities of cash in order to unlock the potential of
these products, so they pushed to get them on the market and profitable as
quickly as possible.  Adding in additional security features could have 
required additional time and money; it also might have slowed the adoption of
the technology or product.  Sometimes, however, the spec is right but the
implementation is fouled.  I believe an excellent example of this can be seen 
in Bluetooth pairing.  How many times have you seen a default PIN of 0000 for
a device?  

Governments, especially their military components, have a lot of incentive to
keep things secure.  However, so much of the technology that was originally
built for military use is now being used by consumers in a way that they don't
even realize is insecure.

For consumers, technology generally succeeds only once people find it easy
enough to use and adopt it.  This presents a challenge for those creating new
products and technologies to find the correct balance between ease of use and
underlying security.  Too many times we see security being downplayed so as to
simplify usability, but this is a recipe for disaster.  The best options are 
those that 

### The Future 

Nowadays, we are seeing shifts towards a world where security is considered
during the beginning stages of projects, instead of as an afterthought.  This is
excellent news, but it doesn't mean we're in the clear yet.  Any software
developer knows that there are always bugs in code.  Some of them can be
catastrophic, but only when extremely specific scenarios occur.  Even so, any 
product or technology that attempts to reduce security holes from the start is
already in a better place than most.

Plans for updating and replacing existing technologies need to be created, and
their implementation needs to begin quickly to allow time for consumers to
adopt them.  Some technologies that are impacted and need to be updated
include GPS, cellular telephony, and the electrical grid.  It is quite obvious
that these systems are critical to everyday life in the modern area.  In some
cases, inroads are being made to secure them.  In others, known vulnerabilities
continue to exist without repair.

Much like our physical infrastructure, we must invest and maintain these systems
to ensure they will continue to operate.  We can choose to pay the cost now, which
is admittedly quite expensive, or we will find ourselves with no choice to pay
even more in the future...  possibly after something disastrous has happened.
