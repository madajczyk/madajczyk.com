It was one of the most unexpected things for me to see on my trip to Kansas City.  Iowa rest stops have wireless internet access available!

The service is provided by [I Spot Access][1], and apparently has been available since [June 2004][2].  Anybody who signs up for an account with the provider has the ability to surf free of charge for 30 minutes.  Now that's a good way to market your product.

Well, that, and also the highway signs that are posted for all to see!
