title: Extra Help with Moving
---

<p>So the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">President</a> is making a stop in Green Bay on Thursday.  He's giving a speech at a local firm and then going to a fundraiser.  The company he's giving a speech at is about a block from my new duplex.  I was planning on starting to move right about the same time.</p>
<p>I've been telling people he's really coming to Green Bay just to give me a hand.  Is that wrong?  I think he's bringing a <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/">bunch of guys</a> with him to help out.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I <a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060809/GPG0101/608090544/1207/GPGnews">work with this guy</a>.  Hey, wait, maybe Karl will volunteer to help too?</p>
