Suggestion: If you plan on rebuilding your computer system, try not to do it at 12:45 a.m. Wow. I decided to rebuild my workstation and put Windows 2000 Professional on, which is something I've been meaning to do for about a week. To make a long story short, I managed to leave a floppy disk in the drive and then I couldn't figure out what I was getting a Non-system disk or disk error message. Damn, I've been seeing those kind of messages since I was twelve years old, and I didn't even think of checking the floppy drive. I actually went to support.microsoft.com to figure out how to build a bootable NTFS floppy. Oops. Sleep is key.
