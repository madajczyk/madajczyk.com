I’m finally getting the site updated. Switched the content over to the new design today. I have to import the existing information still, and I also need to build a CSS file to handle your printer. If you’re checking this site out in Internet Explorer 5.5+ it should look fine. If it doesn’t, and you can somehow read this message, please let me know.
