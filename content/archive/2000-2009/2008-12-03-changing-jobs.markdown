title: Changing Jobs
---
After five and a half years working for Associated Bank, it feels like it is time for a change.  I have decided to take a position with <a href="http://www.tushaus.com" >Tushaus Computer Services</a>, working as a consultant geared primarily towards enterprise design and engineer services.

It's always hard to leave an employer, especially after being there for so long.  There are many, many great people who work there, and after you leave a place, it never quite feels the same.  There have been lots of great changes at the bank, and a few not-so-great changes, but all in all it was a good place to work.  The friendships alone that I take away with me are more than worth it.

So, I'm pretty excited about the new job.  I'll be starting in a few weeks, and I'm looking forward to the challenges it will bring.  I still plan to be staying in Green Bay, as the kids really like their schools.

If you haven't already gotten the details on the going-away party on Friday and wish to attend, let me know...
