I just blew off most of the morning hopping around the web doing various things. For example, I spent hours at [John Halycon's site][1], laughing my ass off. I was here once before a while ago, but didn't have time to check it out. It was worth it. I also stumbled across [Robin Jean's site][2]... and now I have some new wallpaper for my desktop. Sometimes I wonder why I have an interest in blondes.. and then I see one or two (most certainly including my girlfriend in this statement) and then I remember why. I hate to be one to discriminate, but there's something about the color yellow.  And long hair...!

I picked up a 30-day eval of [Macromedia's new product, UltraDev][3]. I downloaded it on a whim, like I used to do when I was connected to the File Shop in Kansas City. I just did a search, and it looks like it was picked up by Birch Internet Services. I remember way back when I help the Sysop install door games... Oh well. I'll let you know if UltraDev is any good. I also downloaded [IBM's WebSphere server][4].. holy 230 megs of download, Batman! I'm going to rebuild the Madajczyk.Com server today, and then maybe we'll give it a go, guv.
