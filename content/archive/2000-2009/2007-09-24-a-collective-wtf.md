I was at today's spectacular Green Bay Packers game (thanks Brian!) against the San Diego Chargers and watched the two teams battle it out.
I expect that there are three things I will remember from this game for quite a while:

* The fact that the Packers have started out 3-0 when nobody seems to have expected it.
* The two Chargers fans who also happened to be beautiful blonde twins.
* The sound the stadium made when the 4th down pass was incomplete.

Hearing 70,000 fans essentially say "What the fuck was THAT?" all at the same time was pretty impressive, even if the reason for it was not.
Even though the Chargers lost, they've still got the Charger Girls.  And those twins.
