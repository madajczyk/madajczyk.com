<p>This just happened a minute ago.  I decided to watch a movie, specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock,_Stock_and_Two_Smoking_Barrels">Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</a> tonight once I had the boys down.</p>
<p>I set the disc in my recently purchased Samsung DVD player and close the drawer.  Then I ran to the fridge to get a drink.  When I returned, I saw the drawer was still open.</p>
<p>Curious.  So I pushed it closed again, and about 2 seconds later it opened up again.  No errors, no warnings, but there it was, sticking it's mechanically operated tongue out at me.  Sonuva....</p>
<p>After a good thirty seconds of pondering, I remembered that I saw Toliver over by the player earlier this evening.  So I took the disc out, picked up the the player, and then rotated the player so that it was facing the floor.</p>
<p>I proceeded to shake the living crap out of it. Lo and behold, out pops a 128 mb CompactFlash card of which Toliver apparently decided that he needed to install into the DVD player slot.</p>
<p>I'm somewhat waiting for the <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/">MPAA</a> to show up and start screaming that I was trying to dupe the disc onto the CompactFlash card...</p>
