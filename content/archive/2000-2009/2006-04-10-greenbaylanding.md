Get the hell out of my way, [Oliver Stone](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000231/).

I uploaded a video to Google Video of a landing that Howard made into Austin Straubel on March 26th.  The vid was pretty good quality to start with, and I'm actually impressed with how good it transferred over. Make sure you're ready to crank the volume at the end... in some ways, Howard's comments are the best part.  They're not exactly the kind of words designed to make a passenger feel better.

I have a ton of pictures from the flight too, but I've been too lazy to get them posted. I was supposed to go flying with Howard again last weekend, but thanks to a miscommunication, I ended up having to bow out.  Grrrr.
