title: Miniskirts Sell

Knock knock.

The tiniest of sounds on the door to my apartment.  I didn't even hear it, but one of the boys did.  I didn't buzz anybody in, so I was a bit nervous.
  *I don't want to buy anything right now.*

I opened the door to see a young woman selling magazines.  You know the kind, they're selling 'em to make money, or earn points, or some such thing.  *Hmmm, that miniskirt isn't covering that much, but it's hot out today.*

Unfortunately she was a bit cute.  And since it's been quite a while since *that's* happened, I listened for a bit.  *That crop top definitely helped in making my decision.*

She looked a little hot standing in the doorway.  She asked if she could come in while she showed me the magazine choices.  *Sure! Aw hell, you want to *sit* at the table?  Stupid me...*

Then the boys began acting up.  Just a little bit, just to take away a bit of my attention.  *My your tummy looks nice.  You must work out?*

The boys started showing off.  I remember a fleeting thought about what could happen if she decided she liked the boys... anybody who likes the boys is OK in my book.  *Hey! It's not my fault I keep looking at you like that, you've got glitter all over your shirt.  It's SHINY!*

She started telling me some of the exotic places she could go from this promotion and that she could take a friend.  Of course she made the requisite joke about me going along.  *Hmm, Is my passport current?*

She made the expected personal plea to help her out.  *Wow does she ever have nice eyes.  Where's my #@!%ing checkbook?*

After she concluded the sale she wrote some letters on the receipt and gave me 10 seconds to guess what they meant; if I guessed correctly, she'd stop back and wash/wax my car.  *For the love of...  yeah, I know, it's BS, but she already looks good now.  Imagine a sponge, soap bucket, etc....  holy hell.*

WTF?  How did that happen?  *What the hell am I going to do with 20 copies of Home and Garden?!?*
