These lyrics are definitely speaking to me right now...

i hurt myself today to see if I still feel

i focus on the pain the only thing that's real

the needle tears a hole the old familiar sting

try to kill it all away but i remember everything

what have i become my sweetest friend

everyone i know goes away in the end
