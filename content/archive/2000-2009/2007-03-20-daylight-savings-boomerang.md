title: Daylight Savings Boomerang
---
So, since it's been a bit since I've put anything up here, I should point out that spring is on the way, even the though the last time I made a post it was still last year.  Stupid daylight savings time changes.

A lot of things have happened in the last few months, although nothing was really noteworthy.  I managed to break my garage door somehow, got a new PC, had my stupid Christmas tree boomerang back to me, gone out for drinks with friends and coworkers, and otherwise have generally made a nuisance of myself.  I was really good at keeping up with the last one.

In other words, everything is on track as expected.  Not much else to say besides that right now.  I have the ideas for a few additional posts, but in the last 2 months or so I've really had a case of laziness.  Sucks.
