Hello... welcome to yet another busy damn year in my life. I picked up a job with an MIS department at a local telemarketing company about a week ago, so I am now back to working full time. Plus, FedEx fnally put me on their staff from 5:30pm until about 9pm almost every weekday. That should give me about 60 hours a week. Oh yeah, plus I am working with another local business to computerize their inventory. That will have to wait until the weekend. I'm still not sure when I'm going to sleep....
