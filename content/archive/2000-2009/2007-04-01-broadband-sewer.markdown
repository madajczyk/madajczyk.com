<p>Google has announced that they are offering <a href="http://www.google.com/tisp">free broadband service</a>, called <a href="http://www.google.com/tisp">TiSP</a>.  The delivery system is extremely forward thinking... forget electricity... instead, use the local sewer system.  <a href="http://www.google.com/tisp/install.html">Installation</a> is accomplished via their GFlush system and fiber-optic cabling. The best part is in their FAQ:</p>
