title: Daycare Parking

Okay, rant time.

In front of my daycare, there are four handicapped parking spaces, with two on either side of the main entrance.  Now that it's getting colder, every day, almost without fail, at least one of those spots is filled by a empty, running car.  Somebody who's dropping off their kids.

Now, I've been going to this place for over a year.. you get to know people.  I know who drives the car, and I know they're not disabled.  Maybe the daycare shouldn't have quite as many disabled parking spaces, but that doesn't make those spaces become disabled and 5-minute loading/unloading, either.

Park in the regular parking spots, jerks.  It's not going to kill you to walk the extra 15 feet... and that applies to the cute women who do it because they figure that nobody will yell at them.  I suggest voluntary compliance, otherwise I'll make a new rule that the cuter the women are, the farther away they have to park.

Which then means that all the single guys can watch them walk in.  Hey, don't judge me!
