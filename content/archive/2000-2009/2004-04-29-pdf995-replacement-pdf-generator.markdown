Jeremy Surma just sent me this link: [http://www.pdf995.com][1].

Available on this site are three tools to create PDF documents for free or very low price (to remove advertisements). There’s also instructions on how to share the PDF generator across a network... took me about two minutes to do. Very nice.

There’s other tools available from their corporate site; I haven’t had much time to check them out, but I plan to soon.
