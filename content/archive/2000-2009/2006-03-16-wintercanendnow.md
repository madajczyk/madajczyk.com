title: Winter Can End Now

Okay.  Enough is enough.  It's the middle of March.  Go away, winter!

I'm in Minneapolis right now for my day job, and it's snowing like hell outside.  I know that I should be used to it since I live in Green Bay, but I'm not.  The sad part is that the forecast for Green Bay doesn't have near the amount of predicted snowfall as Minneapolis.

Snow sucks.
