title: Google + AOL = Nightmare
---
Everything [AOL][1] touches turns to crap.

I think that the idea behind AOL is simple: make things easy to use and available to everybody.  That's not a bad thought in general, but AOL manages to do it in a way that ticks me off... every time.

So now that [Google][2] and AOL are moving past first base, some of the ugly details are starting to come out.  For example, [this post on Slashdot][3] that suggests that they will be adding logos and graphics to a lot of the advertising that is shown on the Google sites.

This concerns me greatly.  I don't care for advertising any more than anybody else, but I recognize it's value and understand that in today's society it is essential to sell products.  However, Google has always done it so much better with the text ads.  They're non-obtrusive, easy to deal with, and sometimes very useful.  I can pay attention to them or not, and I feel like I get a choice.

Now, I don't want to start knocking on this change until I see it go live, but I will say that I'm worried about the direction this is going.  Yes, Google is a public company now, and they need to increase shareholder revenue... but, try and do so without ticking off your core user base... please?
