title: The Perplexity of Being Single
---
So, here is the general cluster I am pondering right now.

First off, being single pretty much sucks.  On a daily basis most people run into a number of single, eligible members of the opposite sex.  That's great, but you never know what they're thinking.

For example, consider the young lady working at the counter of the hotel I'm staying at.  She's attractive and nice, and seemed friendly.  Could be single, could be attached.  Most likely just being nice because I'm a customer.  Should I check and see if she's interested or just leave well enough alone?  Being the shy bugger that I am, I choose to leave it alone  (not to mention that I live 4 hours away).

Did I just pass on true love and happily-ever-after?  Most likely not.  I sincerely doubt she was interested in me.  Hell, *I'm* not even interested in me, so why should she be?  In reality though, these kinds of situations seem to happen every day.  I suppose the trick is figuring out when there's interest and when there isn't.  I've never been good at that.

On another note, I had dinner at [Davanni's](https://www.davannis.com/) tonight over in Eagan.  The best brownies around, and the pizza was pretty good too.  Although, maybe I was just hungry.  For that matter, I might as well mention [Axel's River Grille](https://axelsrestaurants.com/), which is where I went last night.  I was there once before and had one of the best steaks ever.  I tried to reproduce it last night... it was good, but just wasn't the same.

What the hell is blue cheese anyway?
