The first time I got a ticket was just over 10 years ago.

I was on 54, on the way back from work in Waupaca.  It was just before prom, and I had just found out that the woman I had been intending to take to prom was planning on meeting some other guy there.  I got a little pissed and that was the end of that.

So here it was, almost prom time, and I was without a date.  I was pissed and was taking it out on the car in the form of speeding.  Then I saw the State Trooper.  Whoops.  There went $150.

I remember that the Soundgarden song Spoonman was on the radio.  This sticks out in my head because it was on the radio the first time I got pulled over, the day of my 16th birthday.  We had it turned up so loud we could barely hear the siren.  It is still one of my favorite songs.

I'm posting about it because I heard it on my way to pick the boys up from the ex's house; they were there for the weekend.  I heard it and started thinking back to when life was a little bit simpler.  Which just happens to coincide with being before I got involved with my ex.  Hmm.  Imagine that.

Perhaps I'll share the story of when I first got pulled over soon; its much better than this drivel.  Seriously, who lets me type?  Take the keyboard away!  It's for your own safety!
