Abandon hope all ye who enter here.<br />
<br />
It has been horribly difficult to watch the Packers play this year.  They looked okay at first, although Ryan Grant's running game was a little off at first.  They they had a few losses, and then a huge win against the Colts.  Going into the bye week, it looked like there were finally coming together.<br />
<br />
Oops.<br />
<br />
Since the bye week, they've lost 6 of their last 7 games.  Too many of those have been close games that have been lost in the last few minutes.  Unfortunately though, it just doesn't matter how well you play for the first 55 minutes when you lose it in the last 5.<br />
<br />
Don't be fooled, there's talent there.  Somewhere.  But it obviously just isn't coming together as expected.  I've seen reports that the Packers have been eliminated from the playoffs... no kidding.  But that's not the worst of it.  The worst part is the last regularly scheduled game on the 28th... against the Lions.<br />
<br />
I know, I know... my hometown team is having one of the worst seasons on record.  But here's the problem.  If they lose against the Saints, and they most likely will, they're going to throw everything into that last game.  Everything.  Plus, all eyes will be on the game at Lambeau to see if the Lions go 0 for 16.<br />
<br />
The Packers had better make sure they take that game seriously and win it, because they keep finding new ways to lose them.  The Pack CANNOT be the team that gets beaten by the 0 and 15 team...  this town gets cold when the team loses one game.  Imagine how frigid it would be if we lose that one.  Imagine the questions that will be asked for the next 6 months...
