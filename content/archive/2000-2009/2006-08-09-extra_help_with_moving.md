title: Extra Help with Moving
---

So the President is making a stop in Green Bay on Thursday.  He's giving a speech at a local firm and then going to a fundraiser.  The company he's giving a speech at is about a block from my new duplex.  I was planning on starting to move right about the same time.

I've been telling people he's really coming to Green Bay just to give me a hand.  Is that wrong?  I think he's bringing a [bunch of guys](https://www.secretservice.gov/) with him to help out.
