[Linksys Unveils New DVD Player/Digital Media Adapter][1]

Holy hell, does this thing look cool or what? Depending on pricing, this should go over pretty well. I know I’m already interested in it. Of course, Linksys and the rest of the industry are calling 802.11g "Wireless-G" now. Sounds a little goofy, but I’m sure we’ll get used to it.
