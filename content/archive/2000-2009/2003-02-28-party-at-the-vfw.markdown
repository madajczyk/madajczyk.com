It’s been over 6 months since I left my position at my last company. In style with the times, they have begun to liquidate positions. One of my very dear friends was let go two weeks ago, so a going away party was thrown. Additionally it was my best friend’s birthday recently, so that got lumped in to the party. I managed to stay sober and enjoy the fun, but being sober and unable to dance does make for a slighly less enjoyable time. Regardless, I had a great time seing everybody I used to work with. Why is it you never recall the place you worked, so much as the people?

Pictures have been posted, surprisingly, in the picture section.
