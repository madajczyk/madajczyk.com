title: Robbed... again?

You know it's time to sell a branch when it keeps getting robbed... even when the customers can't go inside!

> A bank that has been robbed so many times it bans customers from coming inside was held up again anyway on Friday.

> Anyone using the Bank of America branch on Silver Hill Rd. has been forced to go to the drive-up or the ATM for the last few months, after managers got fed up with the repeated heists. But when one of the tellers went out for a break, a robber saw a window of opportunity.

> "There were two tellers inside of this bank. One of the tellers left to run over to the drug store and as she was walking back, a suspect wearing dark clothing produced a gun and forced her inside the bank," Cpl. Diane Richardson of the Prince George's County police. The suspect tried to lock both tellers in the vault, but could not.
