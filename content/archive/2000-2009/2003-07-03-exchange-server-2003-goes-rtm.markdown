title: Exchange Server 2003 Goes RTM

With working the new job and all, I’ve hardly had a chance to see what’s new in the world. One thing that I wasn’t expecting was this: Microsoft has announced that Exchange Server 2003 has been Released to Manufacturing (RTM). Coolness! If you haven’t checked it out, you really should. I thought that the jump from 5.5 to 2000 was worthwhile, but the changes in OWA alone make 2003 required.

The big question is… Will Microsoft be shipping this as part of their [Action Pack][1] for small IT businesses? I assume they will. This is important to me, as I’m a subscriber.
