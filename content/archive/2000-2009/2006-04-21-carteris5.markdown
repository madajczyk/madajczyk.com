title: Carter is 5
---
<p>It's hard to believe it's been 5 years since Carter entered my life.  So many things have changed.  He's grown so much, and learned so much.  I've relocated a few times, lost a fiancee, gained a good job, built a company...</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the next few years, although it just gets harder from here: kindergarten, girls...  there's so much for him to learn and experience.  Nothing beats watching a child learn and grow each day.</p>
<p>I can't imagine my life without him.  Happy birthday Carter!</p>
