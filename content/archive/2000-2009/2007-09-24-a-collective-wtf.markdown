<p>I was at today's spectacular <a  href="http://www.packers.com/">Green Bay Packers</a> game (thanks Brian!) against the <a  href="http://www.chargers.com/">San Diego Chargers</a> and watched the two teams battle it out.</p>
<p>I expect that there are three things I will remember from this game for quite a while:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The fact that the Packers have started out 3-0 when nobody seems to have expected it.</li>
    <li>The two Chargers fans who also happened to be beautiful blonde twins.</li>
    <li>The sound the stadium made when the 4th down pass was incomplete.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hearing 70,000 fans essentially say "What the fuck was THAT?" all at the same time was pretty impressive, even if the reason for it was not.</p>
<p>Even though the Chargers lost, they've still got the <a  href="http://www.chargers.com/charger_girls/2007-squad/">Charger Girls</a>.Â  And the twins.</p>
