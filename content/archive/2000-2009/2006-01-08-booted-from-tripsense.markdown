I've been kicked from the [Progressive TripSense][1] research program.

It appears that my car, a 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix, is no longer considered compatible with the TripSense program.  I received this e-mail over the weekend:

Dear TripSense Research Participant:

Thank you again for signing up for the data gathering research program that uses the TripSensorTM to gather information about how you drive.

You may recall when signing up for the program that some vehicles are ineligible for participation because the TripSensor is not compatible with certain vehicle makes and models.

When a TripSense customer reports a problem to us, we investigate it and, if it turns out that that vehicle make and model is incompatible with the TripSensor, we add the vehicle to our "ineligible" list. This means that these vehicles cannot participate in the research program.

We have identified an incompatibility issue with your Pontiac Grand Prix 4 door.  As a result, we need to immediately remove that vehicle from the program, and ask you to return the TripSensor to us for analysis.

We apologize for the inconvenience.  A postage-paid envelope has been sent for you to return the TripSensor.  Once the TripSensor is received, we'll honor the $50 participation incentive.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. We apologize
again for any inconvenience.

Oh well... at least I still get the rebate.
