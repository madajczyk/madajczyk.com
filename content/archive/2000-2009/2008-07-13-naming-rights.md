title: Naming Rights?
---
Seriously, this may be one of the most stupid things I've heard in a while.

> David Partin of Orlando offered the right to name his unborn son to a local radio station that offered $100 worth of free gas to the listener with the most interesting item to trade. Radio hosts Richard Dixon and J. Willoughby took Partin's deal. When the baby is born this winter, he will be named Dixon and Willoughby Partin, with the "and" included.

You've got to be a special kind of stupid to offer naming rights of your child... and for only $100 of free gas?  That's what, 20 gallons?  What a complete jackass.
