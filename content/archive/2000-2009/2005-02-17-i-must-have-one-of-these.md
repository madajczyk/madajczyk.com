title: I must have one of these.

[Dell][1] should be introducing their new monitor, the 2405FPW, on or around March 1st.  This bad boy is 24‚Äù with a widesreen aspect, has 4 USB ports and a 9-in-1 card reader, tons of inputs, and lots of other cool features.  You have the option to do either Picture-in-picture of any two of the inputs, or you can split screen two inputs.

The [best quote from Extremetech][2] was this: "A 24-inch-diagonal, 1920x1200 display could replace two 19-inch displays while consuming less desk space."

I see one of these in my future, hopefully sooner rather than later.
