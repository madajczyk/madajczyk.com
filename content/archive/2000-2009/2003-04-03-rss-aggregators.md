RSS is all the rage now. I’ve been playing with a few different aggregators, which will collect multiple feeds and format them for proper reading.

The latest entry into the foray is [SharpReader][1], a three-pane aggregator, built on the .NET platform. It minimizes to the system tray (Yes!!), supports drag and drop, and a bunch of other awesome features. There are a ton of people talking about it in their weblogs, and it sounds like it’s just going to get better and better.
