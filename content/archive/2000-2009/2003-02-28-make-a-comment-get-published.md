I made a comment regarding a post I saw on [Kiruba Shankar's web site.][1] The next thing I know, I’m reading an article about a blog meet in India, and in the article is a paraphrase of my comment. Small world.

As a sidenote, I’d like to say hi to everybody dropping in from Kiruba’s site. Lots of extra traffic generated in the last few days since I posted that comment. I haven’t gotten around to building a comment system yet, but you can drop me an e-mail using Lee Madajczyk(at)madajczyk(dot).com. Maybe this will force me into finishing up my .NET blogging system, complete with comments?

Nah. Probably not.
