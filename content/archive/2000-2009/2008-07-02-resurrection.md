Wow, it's been almost a year since I posted last.  Shut up, I've been busy.

Here's a list of crap that has changed or happened in the past 9 months:

Toliver turned 4 in November, Carter turned 7 in April.  I turned 30 a few weeks ago.

I've started dating again, believe it or not.

I took a new position at my full-time company.

I got to see a Google StreetView car up close.

I came down with pneumonia.

My company Cartoli moved closer to launching its first web-based project..

I've had about 20 new ideas for new products for my company.  Unfortunately I'm still working on the first one (see above).

At my full-time job, we recently completed a multi-year systems refresh.  It was interesting, but now that it's done, I can start taking vacation time again.

So... while there has been a bit of silence lately, expect that to change.  I plan to convert this blog over to new software shortly, so that'll be my next big thing to accomplish.  I'll probably publish some articles on some of the above things when I get some time, too.
