title: Anybody remember Q-Link?

Okay, this is really sad, but I found myself thinking about Q-Link this evening.  What is Q-Link?  Well, take AOL, subtract about 20 years, and there you have it.  Q-Link was *the* place to go if you had a modem with your Commodore 64.  I remember thinking how cool it would be to get connected, and then how disappointed I was when I hooked up with my 300 baud modem due to the length of time it took to get a page downloaded.

Of course, I remember my father telling me about the expensive modems they used a the Detroit News to transfer copies of the front page between the plants, and how they used to be able to push one full megabyte in about 45 minutes...
