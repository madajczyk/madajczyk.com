It was one of the most unexpected things for me to see on my trip to Kansas City.  Iowa rest stops have wireless internet access available!

The service is provided by I Spot Access, and apparently has been available since June 2004.  Anybody who signs up for an account with the provider has the ability to surf free of charge for 30 minutes.  Now that's a good way to market your product.

Well, that, and also the highway signs that are posted for all to see!
