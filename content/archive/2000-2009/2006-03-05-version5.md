Woo hoo! The latest version of madajczyk.com is here!

Okay, so it's missing a few things.  To make up for it, I recovered a bunch of older posts from the older madajczyk.com sites and even the czyk.org site.

Version 4 of madajczyk.com [2005 - 2006]
Version 3 of madajczyk.com [2000 - 2005]

There were a few other versions and revisions, but trust me, they sucked.  No loss there.  I haven't decided if I'm going to bring the content into the new Subtext powered site or not.  I spent most of the day trying to figure out how to do it, and all I managed to do was give myself a headache.

Anyway, now I feel a little better, since the site is now running from <a href="http://www.dbghosting.com/">dbgHosting</a>... much better to showcase your own company's talents than somebody elses.
