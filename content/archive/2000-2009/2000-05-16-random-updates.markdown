Nothing pisses me off more that something done for a stupid reason. I recently checked a website that I did while I was at my previous job. One quick look told me that it had been ripped apart by somebody else who had inserted code. I understand the reasons, but I can't understand the purpose. Thanks to that, I now need to re-engineer my resume. I no longer want to list the websites that I have worked on. Why not? Because those sites are no longer quality work. They aren't held together by a common bond anymore. There are now two different themes in place, which I just can't stand. This has now renewed my resolve to make this a better website. Screw 'em.
