The [last Ford Mustang rolled off of the assembly line today][1] at the Dearborn Assembly Plant in Dearborn, MI. It will be shut down shortly, although plans are being made to convert part of it into a museum. Henry Ford himself assisted in the design of the initial buildings.

I remember driving past the plant with my Dad from time to time when we still lived in Detroit. Lots of history built up in the Mustang, and at DAP.

I just donâ€™t know if it will be the same when the [2005 model][2] appears later this year. According to the press release, it will be built in the Flat Rock plant.
