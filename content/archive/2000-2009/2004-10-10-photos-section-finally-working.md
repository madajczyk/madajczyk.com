title: Photos Section Finally Working
---
Well, I finally got off of my lazy ass and I got the Photos section working. I've only been talking about doing that for a month or two.

You'll notice, of course, that there really aren't many photos out there. Bite me! It's one in the morning... perhaps I'll post some more in the next few days. Getting that section really kicked the crap out of me.

There's still a lot of work to be done, but at least I'm making progress!
