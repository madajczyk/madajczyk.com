<p>Nobody reads this crap.</p>
<p>That's the mantra I'll take whenever I decide to post on here from now on.  I've done some demographic work: turns out most of the women who visit, like most women I know, are married.  That really pisses off a single guy like me.</p>
<p>Wait, what the hell am I talking about?  I forgot the first line of this post.  <strong>Nobody reads this crap.</strong> Argh.</p>
<p>Anyway, I should get some good text up here for those who DO read this site, either for their job (Hello, FBI Criminal Investigations), or because they absolutely have no choice (Hey there, Googlebot!  How's that site crawling thing working out for ya?). </p>
<p>I got home from work on Monday the 3rd around 8pm after stopping for a few drinks and bugging <a href="http://www.mikegovek.com/">Mike</a> at the liquor store, where he works to support his crack habit.  I opened my car door only to hear a horrendous noise coming from the parking lot next door, which is home to the Oneida Family Fitness and Recreation center.</p>
<p>Anyway, they have they those crackly outdoor speakers to page people.  Either as a joke or accidentally, they left the elevator music pumping out through the outdoor speakers, plain as day.  I guess I could have called the cops or something, but I didn't care that much.  Besides, I needed some content for this site.  Never look a gift horse in the mouth, I suppose.</p>
<p>Long story short... it was blasting away until I got home from the Green Bay fireworks around 10pm.  On the Fourth.</p>
