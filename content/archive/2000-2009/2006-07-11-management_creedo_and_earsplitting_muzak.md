Nobody reads this crap.  That's the mantra I'll take whenever I decide to post on here from now on.

Anyway, I should get some good text up here for those who DO read this site, either for their job (Hello, FBI Criminal Investigations), or because they absolutely have no choice (Hey there, Googlebot!  How's that site crawling thing working out for ya?). 

I got home from work on Monday after bugging Mike at the liquor store, where he works to support his crack habit.  I opened my car door only to hear a horrendous noise coming from the parking lot next door, which is home to the Oneida Family Fitness and Recreation center.

Anyway, they have they those crackly outdoor speakers to page people.  Either as a joke or accidentally, they left the elevator music pumping out through the outdoor speakers, plain as day.  I guess I could have called the cops or something, but I didn't care that much.  Besides, I needed some content for this site.  Never look a gift horse in the mouth, I suppose.

Long story short... it was blasting away until I got home from the Green Bay fireworks around 10pm.  On the Fourth.
