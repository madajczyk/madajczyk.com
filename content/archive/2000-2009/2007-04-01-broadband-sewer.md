Google has announced that they are offering free broadband service called TiSP.  The delivery system is extremely forward thinking... forget electricity... instead, use the local sewer system.  [Installation](https://archive.google.com/tisp/index.html) is accomplished via their GFlush system and fiber-optic cabling. The best part is in their FAQ:

> **Why is TiSP in beta?**
> 
> When things go wrong with TiSP, they go very, very wrong. Let's leave it at that.
