I recently set up a website / blog on behalf of my friend Mike Govek.

I'll be damned if his traffic hasn't exceeded all of the hits I get on all of my websites combined.

Anyway, go visit The Govekian's website.  It's quite entertaining, if nothing else because I still haven't given him access to it yet.
