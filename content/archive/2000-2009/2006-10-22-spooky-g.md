Today the boys and I found ourselves down at [Lambeau Field](https://www.packers.com/lambeau-field/) for their Spooktacular event.  The event itself was OK but nothing great.  Howard and his 2-year-old son Sam were also in attendance.

At one point we found some staff who were handing out stickers with the Packers G logo on it.  Howard's son insisted on wearing the logo immediately, so Howard put it on his shirt.

The funny thing is that Sam was wearing a Halloween shirt that said 'Spooky U' on it, and when Howard put the sticker on Sam he covered the U portion almost completely.

Now his shirt said 'Spooky G'.  Of course, I immediately proceeded to make some comments about that being Sam's ghetto name, etc.

Come to think of it, he is about the right age to start banging...
