<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>The tiniest of sounds on the door to my apartment.  I didn't even hear it, but one of the boys did.  I didn't buzz anybody in, so I was a bit nervous.  <strong><em>I don't want to buy anything right now.</em></strong></p>
<p>I opened the door to see a young woman selling magazines.  You know the kind, they're selling 'em to make money, or earn points, or some such thing.  <strong><em>Hmmm, that miniskirt isn't covering that much, but it's hot out today.</em></strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately she was a bit cute.  And since it's been quite a while since <em>that's</em> happened, I listened for a bit.  <strong><em>That crop top definitely helped in making my decision.</em></strong></p>
<p>She looked a little hot standing in the doorway.  She asked if she could come in while she showed me the magazine choices.  <strong><em>Sure! Aw hell, you want to *sit* at the table?  Stupid me...</em></strong></p>
<p>Then the boys began acting up.  Just a little bit, just to take away a bit of my attention.  <strong><em>My your tummy looks nice.  You must work out?</em></strong></p>
<p>The boys started showing off.  I remember a fleeting thought about what could happen if she decided she liked the boys... anybody who likes the boys is OK in my book.  <em><strong>Hey! It's not my fault I keep looking at you like that, you've got glitter all over your shirt.  It's SHINY!</strong></em></p>
<p>She started telling me some of the exotic places she could go from this promotion and that she could take a friend.  Of course she made the requisite joke about me going along.  <strong><em>Hmm, Is my passport current?</em></strong></p>
<p>She made the expected personal plea to help her out.  <em><strong>Wow does she ever have nice eyes.  Where's my #*!%ing checkbook?</strong></em></p>
<p>After she concluded the sale she wrote some letters on the receipt and gave me 10 seconds to guess what they meant; if I guessed correctly, she'd stop back and wash/wax my car.  <strong><em>For the love of...  yeah, I know, it's BS, but she already looks good now.  Imagine a sponge, soap bucket, etc....  holy hell.</em></strong></p>
<p>WTF?  How did that happen?  <strong><em>What the hell am I going to do with 20 copies of Home and Garden?!?</em></strong></p>
