title: Foo Fighters and Three Days Grace
---
On Friday, August 29th, a bunch of us headed down to Milwaukee to see Foo Fighters and Three Days Grace play.  It was an awesome concert.

Parking was a small nightmare.   Thankfully Proton had the GPS unit <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">that I won and he stole from me</span> installed so we were able to navigate around.  We found some parking and walked through the park, down a steep hill, and then headed to the concert site.

We got there early enough that we had some extra time to kill before the gates opened up.  When we headed in, we each received a wristband that granted access to the 200 feet or so closest to the stage.

The best part of getting in was when Kris decided to smuggle in his camera.  Cameras were prohibited, so he "tucked it away" in an attempt to hold on to it.  The guards didn't even bother to pat him down.

The show was great.  Unlike the great smuggler Kris, I did not have a camera, so I tried using the camera on my phone.  I'm sure you can guess how well most of those turned out, but I did have success on a few pictures.  I tried taking a few videos but haven't looked to see if any turned out.

It was a good pairing, they sounded great, and it ended up being a really good night.  Our parking issues from earlier worked out well, as we were able to hit the highway pretty quickly.  Special thanks to Proton for driving and to Kris for his valiant attempts at remote stalking!
