Around 3:30 this morning, Toliver woke up barking like a seal... the sure sign of [croup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croup). 

Poor Toli has suffered from respiratory ailments since he was born, basically.  When he was little, he had two trips to the hospital for [RSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus), one only two months after he was born, and then again in August 2005.

Ever since then, he gets croup at least once or twice a year.  Usually it's at night, which always makes for a fun evening.  Unfortunately, it also is "provoked or worsened by agitation or crying", which pretty much describes a pissed off kid at 3 in the morning who can't breathe.

Lucky for Toli, I'm a dad who comes prepared.  Due to the respiratory problems that both he and Carter have had, I own a personal nebulizer kit.  Unlucky for Toli, all I have is albuterol, which isn't effective (epinephrine is probably the only thing that DOES work effectively, but has limited life.), so I used saline instead.  So, we spent quite a bit of time in the bathroom this morning attempting to get Toli's breathing under control.

If he's still having trouble in the morning, off to the doctor's office we go...
