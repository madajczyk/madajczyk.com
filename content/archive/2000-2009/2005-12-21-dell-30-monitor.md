Mother of God.

Just when I thought I was done... Dell is introducing a 30" widescreen flat panel.  This is the kind of forced upgrade that just drives a computer geek like me nuts.  Or it would if I cared.  6" more doesn't do a whole lot for me at this point since I already own a 2405FPW... but if I was still on a 17" or 19", this would be the one I'd want.

Money isn't that important, is it?
