title: Cool Firefox Finds
---
I've been using Mozilla Firefox for over a year now. I've seen a lot of feature enhancements, product name changes, and cool new features. I wanted to post some of the interesting things I've found, both for my own archive and also for the enjoyment of others.

Firstly, for anybody who doesn't know it, Firefox allows you to download extensions, or plug-ins, to make the browser do all kinds of cool things. I would love to produce a plug-in, but honestly, everytime I have an idea, I'm able to find a plug-in that's already available and matureâ€¦. it's simply amazing!

One of the first things you notice when you first install an extension is the delay. Before it will allow you to install, it forces you to wait 3 seconds. Although I knew this was a security fix, I couldn't figure out why until I happened upon[ this article][1], which really explained the whole thing. Very sneaky, and a very elegant work-around.

Some of the plug-ins I've found handy include:

[Adblock][2] - Blocks ads via regular expressions. Awesome!

[ChromEdit][3] - A Simple User Profile File Editor

[Gmail Notifier][4] - Notifies you when new mail arrives

[Google Pagerank Status][5] - The only reason I used to ever go into IE.

[Linkification][6]- Surrounds plain text URLs with anchor tags

[Sage][7] - A lightweight RSS and ATOM feed aggregator

[SwitchProxy Tool][8] - Allows you to become anonymous, also multiple proxies.
