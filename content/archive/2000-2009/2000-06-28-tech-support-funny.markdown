When I was at work yesterday, I ran across this paragraph in a technical support knowledgebase: 

"ProductName" has no recommended settings for DCOM properties. Any reasonable computer professional, however, should be able to determine whether or not specific settings within these screens are causing the errors launching applications that are noted. 

**Translation:**

"We don't want to get into trouble, so we're going to let you figure it out on your own. Let us know when you've got it all figured out, okay?"
