So, one bad thing that came out of my past relationship ending is that I lost contact with a bunch of good friends.  I'm sure this is something that happens normally, and there definitely is no blame on either side for it... it just happened.

Anyway, I've been doing my best to hook back up with some of them and see how life is treating them.  Tonight I found Jeromy, Chris, and Carrie... in the past month, I've also talked to a bunch of other people who I lost contact with.  It's good knowing that people you know and care about are out there, even if you do lose track of them.

I do feel guilty about not keeping up with them though.  I guess I'll be sending out a lot of Christmas cards.
