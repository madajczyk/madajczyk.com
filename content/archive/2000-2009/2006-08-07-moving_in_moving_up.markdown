<p>What the hell do I know about furniture?</p>
<p>I decided that even though I'm a bachelor now, the boys and I should step it up a bit.  Since the ex moved out, I haven't had much in the way of furniture for the living room.  Down to the bare essentials, really.  Couch?  Check.  TV?  Check.  Badass AV setup?  Check, although I never installed it at the apartment.</p>
<p>What more could a guy need?</p>
<p>Well, I decided that since I'm renting a nice duplex starting Thursday (yeah yeah, get off my ass, I'll buy a house as soon as I can afford it), I should upgrade my furniture.  Obviously the point here is that I'm trying to get women to actually _want_ to come into the house.</p>
<p>So I bought a full living room furniture set on Saturday.  It will be nice; it's the one thing I don't have to move, and it will basically take care of an entire room, give or take.  Now I own a couch, loveseat, and chair.</p>
<p>So, back to the first question?  I know that I have a lot of places to sit now.  Now I just need to start getting dates.  Hmm, in business parlance, that could be referred to as <strong>Return On Investment</strong>...</p>
