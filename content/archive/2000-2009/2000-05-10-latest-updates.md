Hello everyone. Thanks again for checking out this page. I'm working on adding a few more features as I think of them, mainly because I don't want this site to be like 10,000 other web pages.

Since this page is a mix of business and personal information, I am constantly looking to expand the site both laterally and vertically. I have recently been rebuked by my good buddy Jeromy, who's over in England with the USAF, that the site isn't interesting anymore. I intend to change that as soon as possible. Expect to see some pictures popping up pretty soon, ranging from bland introduction pictures to the truly bizarre.

I also have an idea concerning employer / employee relations, but I won't spoil the surprise. Please send an e-mail to me with your suggestions. Thanks.
