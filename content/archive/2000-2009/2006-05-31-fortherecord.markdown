<p>I'm getting tired of having to put things back together in my life.</p>
<p>In the past year, much of my life has been uprooted, and I've been the one who has held it all together.  Don't get me wrong: I've had support from friends and family, and I'm very grateful for it, but the final determination of sink or swim would be on how well I managed to keep on with life.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes I'm a single Dad.  Granted, the boys' Mom is involved, but I still take the primary role without a shadow of a doubt.  This isn't a problem for me in the normal sense; I absolutely love the time I get to spend with my boys and I crave it when they're not with me.</p>
<p>However, I tend to put myself on the back burner a bit when it comes to other things.  My boys come first, which isn't a problem.  But...  I haven't had a relationship since she left me for her new boyfriend last year.  I guess I've had the odd date or two but nothing substantial in the least.  No worries for her; she had a new boyfriend lined up a week before she moved out.</p>
<p>Each and every time my kids mention their mother, it manages to bring back a little of the pain.  I've learned that it's hard to trust <strong>anyone</strong> once you've been cheated on (and apparently I'm a multiple qualifier for that distinction)... maybe that's a little bit of why I haven't brought anybody into my life.  Not to mention that the (very) few attempts I've made resulted in failure.  Dammit.</p>
<p>In all reality, I've made a lot of progress towards getting on with life, but sometimes I wonder how much I have left to go and when it will end.  Let me tell you, I'm ready to put this part of my life into the past.</p>
<p>Damn, it's almost been a year already.  Stupid calendar.</p>
