When I arrived home this evening, I noticed that my neighbors across the street had put out a large amount of garbage for pickup. Trash day isn't until Thursday, but it's not the first time they were early.

In the past 90 minutes, a minimum of 4 people have stopped to pick through the pile of debris. Now, Packerland Drive isn't exactly a quiet street, but isn't that a bit much? And it's not like I was staring out the window the whole time, either.

I'm all about not wasting things, but I leave the trash digging to others.
