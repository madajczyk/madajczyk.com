I've managed to see two movies in the theatre in the past few months, which is amazing because I hardly go out to movies anymore thanks to Netflix... there just isn't a need anymore.

But, I ended up making an exception for two movies.  I went to see Hancock about a week ago. Although it wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be, it was all right.  Will Smith did a pretty good job of playing a jackass.

I also watched The Dark Knight, and it was absolutely great.  Obviously there was a lot of hype around Heath Ledger's character and whatnot, and hype aside, he really did produce a great performance.  The entire movie was well-written and very entertaining, and even with the 2 1/2 hour length, it was very easy to enjoy.

As far as movie prices... I just don't know.  We saw The Dark Knight for $6.50 each, so that wasn't so bad.  But catching the 8:00 movie bumped the price to $8.75...  that's a hefty sum for a movie, no matter how you look at it.  Even after you look at all the costs of running a movie theatre, it's still pretty expensive.  While I'm addicted to movies, at least I've been able to wait until the DVD release and watch them at home, which keeps me on budget.  Kind of.
