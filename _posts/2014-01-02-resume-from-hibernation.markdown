After an entire year of slacking, it's time I get this site spun back up.

I've moved away from running a Wordpress site.  I really enjoyed the continuous integration setup I had in place for automatically publishing code file changes from [BitBucket][1] to [Windows Azure][2].  But then I stopped messing with it.

Looking back, a number of things happened personally that made it hard to keep up with this site.  Instead of writing about them via a public website, I started keeping tracking of them with the excellent [Momento][3] application.  Things happen in life, and it's how we deal with them that defines us as people.

Anyway, I've moved this site over to [GitHub Pages][4].  I've been meaning to move the site since September or October, but finally got tired of paying $10 per month to host a website I really wasn't working on.  In early December, I came across a [post from Phil Haack][5] about how he had migrated to GitHub Pages, and decided to give it a shot.  I even stole his theme temporarily, but have been making a number of custom changes.  The template features in [Jekyll][6] make it a snap to do.

Sadly, in that same article, Phil also bemoaned the demise of [SubText][7]:

> Itâ€™s with a heavy heart that I admit publicly what everyone has known for a while. Subtext is done. None of the main contributors, myself included, have made a commit in a long while.

Initially, I built my first site on [Blogger][8].  After a couple of years of that, I moved over to SubText and ran it on for quite a while.  I made other half-hearted attempts to run other software, but just couldn't find anything I liked.  SubText really was the software that I spent most of my time creating content on.  I'll miss that package.

At some point I'll get into more detail on how I have this site set up with GitHub and Jekyll.  There a number of other resources out there that will help you get things running.  Most of them helped, but I ran into a few snags that took me a little while to work through.  I can't help but notice some of the similarities between Jekyll and Blogger, but I definitely feel like I have a lot more power under Jekyll.  This in spite of the fact that GitHub Pages doesn't allow custom plugins to run; but the simple solution is to run Jekyll locally and then check in the published content.  This is similar to how [Octopress][9] runs. 

Anyway... maybe I'll actually stick with creating content on this site for a while.  I don't care if it's considering blogging or writing or just simply blathering on.  I look forward to having an outlet to randomly throw some words up to from time to time, because sometimes I vehemently feel like I need to say something that absolutely nobody will read.
