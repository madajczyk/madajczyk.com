Just a quick update to let you know what's up. Currently, I have a completely redesigned HTML version of the site, which I can hopefully launch in the next week or two. There's a bunch of work, so please bear with me. I am going to work on a Flash version as well, but I need to get a few more things figured out first. 

Special thanks to Brando, who will be the first contributing author to the new site. Hopefully I can add some more people so that I'm not boring you all the time! Anybody interested in posting on a semi-regular basis, please drop me a line.
