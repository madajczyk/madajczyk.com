Wow. A follow-up to yesterday's post. I had just finshed watching a wacky ass movie, Eye of the Beholder, when I decided to check in on all things Net. Lo and behold, a quick note from [Robin Jean][1], who thanked me for the link in yesterday's posts. I was suitably impressed. It's not often that you find a beautiful woman who not only checks her referrer logs, but sends a thank you e-mail as well. 

In other news.. I plan on moving the content of czyk.org over to madajczyk.com, which is my own personal server rigged up on a DSL line. Don't tell my ISP, because I'm supposed to have a dynamic IP. Oh well, fsck 'em if they can't take a joke. **IPCONFIG /RENEW** is a great command. More details on how to drive your local ISP crazy as soon as I get the change moved over.
