I need some fireworks. Fire! Work continues on madajczyk.com, but will most likely take a few more days. I'm going to be working with some truly cool stuff, like XML. I also plan on hooking up to a SQL 7 database for parts of the website. In addition, I've got a web application I want to build, mainly 'cause I've had the tools to build it for the last year and I never put them to use... Oh well. Enjoy the holiday!
