Right above this post, I mention that I will be updating this site each and every day. Whoops. Apparently my resolve wasn't exactly what I thought it was. I've been busy with a new job and with trying to get madajczyk.com operational. Oh well. Maybe I'll do another update before the end of June. 

Oh yeah, piss off, Surma. ;)
