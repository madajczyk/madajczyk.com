<p>Okay, seriously.  The wristband fad is over.</p>
<p>Firstly, I'm tired of trying to figure out what the different colors mean.  Secondly, yeah sure, it's nice that you support a cause or a charity or something else that helps people out.  That makes you feel good.  It eases your conscience, makes you feel about yourself, and an angel may even get its wings.</p>
<p>But just because you're wearing a wristband doesn't mean I have to care.  Nor does it make you a better person for advertising your philanthropy.</p>
<p>The company I work for has chosen to support a particular charity.  As part of the incentive to raise money, a wristband was distributed.  To everybody.  In the corporate color.  With the corporate logo and whatnot on it.  Jesuchristo!  The pressure!  If I don't donate, it's entirely possible they'll move me to the basement.  Without my stapler!!</p>
<p>What ever happened to just helping people out without looking for the angle?  I donated money last year, but you probably didn't know that?  Why would you?  It's something I chose to do, but I don't need your confirmation that I've done a <strong>Good Thing<sup>TM</sup></strong>.  I do it because I felt it was the right thing to do and I wanted the chance to help somebody out.</p>
<p>Why is that so many people need some kind of validation before doing the right thing?</p>
