<p>Ashwaubenon schools are closed for spring break next week.  This means that Carter and Toliver are staying at their Mom's house at her request.</p>
<p>I haven't decided how I feel about this yet.  It's great that they can spend some good quality time with their mother, and I know that I can use the break, but it just seems weird when they're not here.  My place is obviously designed for a family, and it's disconcerting when the majority of the family isn't around.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I face when the boys aren't here is my own laziness.  When they're here, I make all kinds of plans of things I will do to occupy myself when they're gone.  But, once they've actually left, I find it very difficult to begin following through.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure there's no way I'll make it nine days without seeing the boys.  It's hardly been 24 hours and I'm already having trouble with the fact that they're not around.  I've been productive for at least part of today, so that's good at least.  If I keep this up, perhaps I'll make it through the whole week.</p>
<p>Of course, that's when I remember that my ex wants to take the boys for the majority of the summer.  Now how am I supposed to handle that?</p>
