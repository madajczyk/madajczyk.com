<p>About damn time.</p>
<p>I completed my last test today, so I have earned three credits from <a href="http://www.fhsu.edu">Fort Hays State University</a>.  I enrolled in April in order to obtain a bachelor's degree, although I am currently undecided as to my major.  While this may not be a big deal to you, it is to me.</p>
<p>Back in 1996 when I decided not to attend college and just go with it, I made a promise to myself that I'd be back in school within ten years.</p>
<p>Oops.  Maybe I should have said twelve years.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy with what I've done so far, especially considering all that has happened over the past 3 - 4 years.  Wait... what the hell do you mean, there's 121 left to go?  Bugger.</p>
<p>Well, with any luck I'll have my degree by 2016.  Bloody hell. that's a long time.</p>
