<p>Hmm.  Now it seems that I only put up new posts when I've been drinking.  Speaking of which, I'd like to thank the cute bartender and a few of those attending the wedding reception at the locat we ended up going to.  Your attendance this evening helped to make this post possible.</p>
<p>I don't have the gift of being able to talk to women.  I know a few guys that do, and for them it comes as naturally as breathing.  That impresses me, because it's something I don't understand.  28 years old, and breasts and curves still intimidate me.  Talking in general is no big deal, but any kind of discussion that may end up in a date is pretty much impossible for me.</p>
<p>Then again, not dating has been working out well.  I've been keeping a majority of my money in my wallet, and I just have one ex to fight with regarding my kids.  So pehaps this is a blessing in disguise.  This isn't to say that there aren't nice, decent, beautiful women out there, but more to say that so far they seem to want very little to do with me.  Grrr.</p>
<p>See, I knew I should have been working tonight instead of going out dirnking.  The ham and cheese sandwich from the grill was pretty tasty, though.</p>
