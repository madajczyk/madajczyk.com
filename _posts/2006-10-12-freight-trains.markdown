<p>Ever feel like you got hit by a freight train?  Or maybe even a few of them?</p>
<p>I got to work this morning feeling fine.  Within half an hour it all went downhill and I haven't felt OK since.</p>
<p>It's two in the damn morning and I can't fall asleep... not because I'm not tired, but because I feel horrible as soon as I lay down.  I just sent my boss an e-mail letting him know I won't be in tomorrow.  There's just no way I can do it.</p>
<p>One advantage of being up so late is that I was able to update the site's look and feel a bit.  Definitely an improvement and the site is finally starting to look like what I want it to look like.</p>
<p>Now all I have to do is put the finishing touches on some sites for my clients and for <a href="https://www.cartoli.com">Cartoli</a> and I'll be all set.</p>
