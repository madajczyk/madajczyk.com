<p>Okay.  Enough is enough.  It's the middle of March.  Go away, winter!</p>
<p>I'm in Minneapolis right now for my day job, and it's snowing like hell outside.  I know that I should be used to it since I live in Green Bay, but I'm not.  The sad part is that the forecast for Green Bay doesn't have near the amount of predicted snowfall as Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Snow sucks.</p>
