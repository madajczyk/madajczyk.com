title: Am I... Becoming Normal?

<p>It suddenly hit me over the weekend.  I think I'm on my way to becoming normal.  Which is odd, because, well, I never used to be normal.  I thought I was normal, but everybody thought different.  Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I'm not working on my <a href="https://www.cartoli.com/">business</a> as much as I used to (and not nearly as much as I should be, come to think of it).</li>
    <li>I'm watching football.  I'm going to tailgate parties.</li>
    <li>I mow my lawn on a regular basis.</li>
    <li>I've just about stopped drinking caffeine.  (dammit, I was good for a week and then Fred guilted me into having some)</li>
    <li>I'm playing pool a lot now  (granted: I have a table in my basement now)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not that these are bad things; they aren't.  But combined they make for a pretty scary realization...  I'm not the oddest one in the room anymore.  Probably not even close.</p>
<p>Damn.  At least I was unique before...</p>
