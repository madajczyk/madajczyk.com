<p>Today the boys and I found ourselves down at <a href="http://www.lambeaufield.com/">Lambeau Field</a> for their Spooktacular event.  The event itself was OK but nothing great.  Howard and his 2-year-old son Sam were also in attendance.</p>
<p>At one point we found some staff who were handing out stickers with the Packers logo on it.  Howard's son insisted on wearing the logo immediately, so Howard put it on his shirt.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that Sam was wearing a Halloween shirt that said 'Spooky U' on it, and when Howard put the sticker on Sam he covered the U portion almost completely.</p>
<p>Now his shirt said 'Spooky G'.  Of course, I immediately proceeded to make some comments about that being Sam's ghetto name, etc.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, he is about the right age to start banging...</p>
