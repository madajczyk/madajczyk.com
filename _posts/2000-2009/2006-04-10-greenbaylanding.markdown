<p>Get the hell out of my way, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000231/">Oliver Stone</a>.   </p>
<p>I uploaded a video to <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> of a landing that Howard made into Austin Straubel on March 26th.  The vid was pretty good quality to start with, and I'm actually impressed with how good it transferred over.</p>
<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2483932079609055731">Check Howard's landing out here</a>.  Make sure you're ready to crank the volume at the end... in some ways, Howard's comments are the best part.  They're not exactly the kind of words designed to make a passenger feel better.</p>
<p>I have a ton of pictures from the flight too, but I've been too lazy to get them posted. I was supposed to go flying with Howard again last weekend, but thanks to a miscommunication with my ex-fiancée, I ended up having to bow out.  Grrrr.</p>
