<p>The optical zoom on today's digital cameras is just friggin' phenomenal.</p>
<p>I purchased a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0504/05042201canons2is.asp">Canon S2 IS</a> over the weekend with a 1 GB memory card.  Of the many features it offers, one includes a 12x optical zoom lens.</p>
<p>12x!!!!</p>
<p>The so-called "super-zoom" cameras are amazing.  From time to time they have a bit of trouble focusing at the outside range of the 12x zoom, but for the most part they seem to be just fine.</p>
<p>I went flying today with Howard and took a ton of pictures.  From an altitude of 4500 feet, I was able to zoom in on a red truck that was on the highway.  Although I can't seem to make out the manufacturer, you can definitely tell that it's a newer model.  And it's extended cab.  <a title="12x Optical Zoom - Red Truck" href="http://madajczyk.com/images/red_truck_zoom.jpg" rel="lightbox">See for yourself.</a></p>
