title: Woodgrain Just Sucks

<p>Am I the only one in the world who hates vehicles with woodgrain interiors??</p>
<p>I've been doing a bit of research on cars and I just can't stand seeing that stupid woodgrain accent trim go around the cabin.  Or worse... some vehicles are put it on the steering wheels or gearshift!!</p>
<p>I just can't see what the point is.  It's supposed to add an air of luxury, but that's just pompous posturing.  We all know it's fake, so what's the damn point?</p>
<p>And it's not like I'm talking about older vehicles like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodie">woodie</a>, either.  Have a look at the brand new <a href="http://www.fordvehicles.com/crossovers/flex/">Ford Flex</a>, it's a prime example.  The base model (which isn't that bad actually) doesn't have the woodgrain option, but the next few models have it standard.  Stop, please!</p>
<p>Nothing is more distracting to me than getting in a vehicle and staring at fake tree crap.</p>
