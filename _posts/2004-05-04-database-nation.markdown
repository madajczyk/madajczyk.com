I was listening to National Public Radio this afternoon during my lunch break when I [heard an interesting story][1] come over the air.

[Reason magazine][2], whom I had not heard of before, is publishing their June 2004 issue with customized covers on the front. Apparently, each of their 40,000 subscribers will receive a copy of the magazine with their name on it in large font, the words "They know where you are...", and an aerial photo of the address to which the magazine is addressed.

Per the guest on the show, Nick Gillespie (the editor-in-chief for the magazine), it only cost around $5000 more to provide the customized covers, mainly thanks to a few generous donations from the various contributors of information (including the satellite photography).

Is this the ultimate mail merge?
