After a multi-year hiatus, I’ve decided it’s time to begin rebuilding my online persona again.

I started posting content my first website in 1998.  I’ve had a love-hate relationship with online publishing ever since.  Some people do a great job of creating fresh content and posting new information on a regular basis.  I, on the other hand, have been somewhat hit or miss.

I’ve worked with many of the popular content creation platforms.  [Blogger][1], [Movable Type][2], [Squarespace][3], [DasBlog][4], [Subtext][5], [ExpressionEngine][6], [TypePad][7], [WordPress][8], [BlogEngine.NET][9], etc.  I was never quite happy with any of them, but that was mostly my problem, not a problem with the platform itself.

Being a developer, I decided to try my hand at building my own platform.  I was sure I could do it better than anyone else.  I picked up a few clients, and worked really hard on it.  Unfortunately I never set a definitive road map for the product, so it floundered before I closed the business a little over three years ago.

This site will be less blog and more individual articles that I decide to publish.  If it goes well, the content should range all over the place.
