> This article was originally posted via Squarespace on a domain name I no longer utilize.  I am consolidating all of my ramblings and drabble here.

One of the domain names I used to hold, czyk.org, has been puchased recently by a company named CZYK Enterprises. I would have never guessed that anybody was actually interested in that domain name.

Ah, wait, I see. A quick check of the WHOIS information reveals that the domain owner has a -czyk last name also.
