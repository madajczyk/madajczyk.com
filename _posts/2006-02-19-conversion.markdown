> This article was originally posted at this domain name on an old blogging system.  I am consolidating all of my ramblings and drabble here.

I am busy working on converting this site over shortly... my tenure with [Squarespace][1], although a pleasant one, is no longer required since I've kicked dbgHosting into high gear.  Who am I to sell products if I don't even use my own resources??

I'll be working to move everything over to my servers... with luck, I'll have this completed by the end of the month.
