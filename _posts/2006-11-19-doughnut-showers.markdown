<p>On Friday, the boys and I decided to treat ourselves to a weekend of decidedly unhealthy breakfasts in the form of Krispy Kreme doughnuts.  Sometimes as I need to rely on incentive to positively reinforce behaviors.  Yeah, that's gotta be it -- definitely not because I have a sweet tooth too.</p>
<p>When we arrived, the boys begged and pleaded to go inside rather than go through the drive-through.  I relented because I decided to get some of that "My Dad is the Greatest! (TM)" feeling going on.  Oh yeah, and even dictators listen to suggestions from the subjugated from time to time.</p>
<p>Of course, anybody who has been to Krispy Kreme is fully aware that the process of making the doughnuts is made visible via glass viewing areas as soon as you walk in the door.  As expected, the boys made a beeline for the viewing area.</p>
<p>The next twenty minutes passed with a flurry of activity as I rushed to satiate the demands of two little boys who thought it was the coolest thing in the world that they could see the production of the doughnuts.  It's a good thing they wash that glass... the boys were practically licking it in an attempt to see what the warm doughnuts tasted like.</p>

<p>As long as it fits within the expectations set forth by the dictator, namely me.</p>
