> This article was originally posted at this domain name on an old blogging system.  I am consolidating all of my ramblings and drabble here.

I've finished migrating madajczyk.com over to [MovableType][1]. I was previously using [DasBlog][2], but I felt a bit limited by it. I couldn't find time to contribute to the project workspace over at [GotDotNet][3], and I needed a way to update content quickly and painlessly.

There are actually two blogs, the standard type blog at madajczyk.com/blog, and another that I hacked together to allow me to serve the rest of the standard content at [madajczyk.com][4].
