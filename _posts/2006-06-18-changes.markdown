<p>Made some design changes to the blog yesterday and today.  I'll probably make a few more changes, but since I'm not quite sure what look I'm going for yet, I don't know when I'll get it changed.</p>
<p>I had intended on doing a lot of work on the <a title="dbgDNS" href="http://www.dbgdns.com/" target="_blank">dbgDNS</a> and <a title="dbgWHOIS" href="http://www.dbgwhois.com/" target="_blank">dbgWHOIS</a> sites this weekend, but just didn't seem to get to them. Perhaps I'll take some vacation time soon. 
</p>
<p>My search for new housing continues.  Granted, I've moved a lot over the past 10 years, but this time I actually have a good reason: I want to get Carter (and Toliver eventually) into a different school district, preferably one that his daycare will work with.  My lease isn't up until the end of August so I've got some time, but I'll probably be moving at the beginning of August to get everything situated.</p>
