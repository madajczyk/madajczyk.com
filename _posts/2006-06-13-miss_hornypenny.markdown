<p>Had an interesting telephone call this evening.  While speaking with a female friend of mine, she happened to mention that was horny.  Very horny.  Not necessarily with me in mind or anything, but just in general.</p>
<p>Dammit, I'm a single guy.  She's a single woman.  That particular comment is enough to ensure that sleep will come hard (okay, that was a singularly poor choice of words) for days.  You just can't do that kind of stuff to a single guy!</p>
<p>Okay, well, maybe she can, because it's not like I'm going anywhere after hearing that.  My attention is now solely and completely focused on the telephone and every word being spoken through it.  Let's be honest, it's probably one of the better offers I've received over the past year, and it was more of a general comment than anything else.</p>
<p>If you've ever watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keen_Eddie">Keen Eddie</a>, you'll understand better if you think about the teasing and beautiful Miss Moneypenny.  If you haven't seen the show, go buy the DVD set.  Now.</p>
<p>It's okay, I'll wait.</p>
<p>Anyway, I doubt there's anything new information-wise in here to most women.  Most of you have figured out how easy it is to wrap a man around your finger, long-term or just for a few minutes.  In our defense, it's not that we're stupid; it's just really hard (ugh!) to think when you're being deprived of oxygen to the brain.</p>
