It was too good to be true. I know that I had read in the past that Yahoo was going to be using the Google search engine, but I was hoping that the format would stay the same. If you take a look at Yahoo now and compare it to Google, you'll see some remarkable similarities. Like the fact that the only difference is that the Yahoo search displays the results in a UL bullet listing. 

Maybe I just don't like change.
