<p>Toliver had a great 3rd birthday today, although I definitely found myself a bit frustrated.  Of course, it was completely my fault.</p>
<p>First, I slacked off when it came to wrapping the presents.  I actually did great (by my standards anyway) and purchased just about everything <a rel="lightbox" title="Toliver's Birthday Cake" atomicselection="true" href="http://madajczyk.com/images/madajczyk_com/madajczyk/WindowsLiveWriter/ToliversBirthday_14EF3/IMG_1038%5B3%5D.jpg"><img style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 5px 0px 5px 5px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" height="180" alt="" width="240" align="right" border="0" src="http://madajczyk.com/images/madajczyk_com/madajczyk/WindowsLiveWriter/ToliversBirthday_14EF3/IMG_1038_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg" /></a> almost two weeks ago.  Since I'm a guy, that's almost unheard of.  Turns out I guessed right; I've only had about an hour or so to myself where I could go shopping.</p>
<p>Last night I made a decision that I would start getting the presents wrapped.  I ended up watching some TV for a while, until it was almost midnight. Crap.  Even worse, rather than actually wrap presents, I decided it would be a good time to install my surround sound in the living room.  Sounds great now, but I still needed to get going.</p>
<p>My backup plan was lunchtime.  Unfortunately I had week willpower against peer pressure so I went down to Charley's with Brian and Preston.  Whoops.  I ended up cutting out of work a bit early, and I was able to get everything squared away by 4:30pm.</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" title="The packaging from hell." atomicselection="true" href="http://madajczyk.com/images/madajczyk_com/madajczyk/WindowsLiveWriter/ToliversBirthday_14EF3/IMG_1034%5B10%5D.jpg"><img style="BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 15px 0px 0px; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px" height="180" alt="" width="240" align="left" border="0" src="http://madajczyk.com/images/madajczyk_com/madajczyk/WindowsLiveWriter/ToliversBirthday_14EF3/IMG_1034_thumb%5B6%5D.jpg" /></a> Toliver had great fun opening his presents, but I had a bit of an issue with the packaging.  Whomever decided it was a good idea to secure a powered truck to a bit of cardboard with 8 screws and then make it essentially impossible to get the bottom side where the screws are deserves to be shot.  I wasted almost 5 minutes just trying to get to the screws.  The photo only shows a small portion of the anger.</p>
<p>Toliver got to choose where he wanted to go for dinner.  He ended up choosing McDonald's.  Not exactly my choice, but I can cope.  That went all right for a while until the boys started getting overexcited, and then it just went downhill from there.</p>
<p>Regardless of the issues I came up against for Toli's birthday (many of them self-inflicted) I think the boys had a blast, and I guess that's what counts.  <a title="Toliver's 3rd Birthday Pictures" href="http://www.madajczyk.com/photos/Tolivers3rdBirthday">More pictures are available</a>.</p>
<p>Excuse me while I go attempt to locate my sanity...</p>
