I feel as if I have arrived at a crossroads.  There appears to be multiple paths, and each leads off in a different direction.  Everything past the crossroads is foggy and cannot be seen.  Cryptic signs appear next to each of the paths, but not enough information is provided to help with the decision process.

I remember well the path from which I came, but I know that if I spend too much time dwelling on how I got here, I will be paralyzed and unable to proceed.  Absence of progress does not progress make, so I know I must push on.  It's difficult to make a decision, but I know I have to make a choice.

So I make my decision and start to move towards my selected path.  As I approach, I see that there are even more choices available than I had originally anticipated.  Additional paths become visible just past the crossroads, providing even more options and choices past the initial selection.

As new information becomes available, it's important to constantly re-evaluate the choices that available based on the information that is known.  But it doesn't mean that the original decision isn't valid... it just means it's important to continue to evaluate and adjust as you get more information.

But the most important question is:  did the crossroads exist before you got there, or did you construct it yourself?
