Big ice storm rolled into town today, leaving roads slippery, and power lines down. Our power was out for about five hoursâ€¦ I had a bunch of development work planned, but nature had other ideas.

Instead, Shay and I played with Carter. We're teaching him "Old McDonald Had A Farm". He really likes the chorus. He also is quite familiar with the word hot, as he kept wanting to touch the candles. A lot.

So I was up until 2 a.m. trying to get caught up on lost development time. This sucks.
