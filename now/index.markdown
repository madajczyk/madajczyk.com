    Great idea!  I've last updated it on Friday, 28 December 2018

Finished the winter semester at [Fort Hays State University][1] a few weeks ago.  Still feeling
burned out, but realized that I'm not that far from earning my [BGS][2] degree, so I guess I'll
power through it.

Just poking around on the site, fixing a few things that have been bothering me.  I think it's
time to set some goals and figure out what I should focus on in 2019, including setting a
writing and publishing schedule for this site.

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Feel free to send a message to
my (probably) pretentious email address:
