    Great idea!  I've last updated it on {{ "now" | date: "%A, %d %B %Y" }}

It's been a busy few months, and summer is already starting to draw to a close.
Boo.  It's amazing how quickly the time can pass if you're not actively
keeping tracking of it, isn't it?

Starting my next semester at [Fort Hays State University][1].  I'm only taking
six credits this time around.  I managed to burn myself out in the Spring
semester, to the point that I almost didn't want to return.  But, I don't want
to give up yet on finishing my [BGS][2] degree.

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Feel free to send a message to
my (probably) pretentious email address:
