I live just outside of Green Bay, WI.  I work for [Humana][1]{:target="_blank"}, in their Information Technology department, as I have for the past handful of years.

I'm continuing to work on updating this website, as I haven't really paid much attention to it over the last couple of years.  You can see updates via the [GitHub repository][4].

I really enjoy reading.  I just finished reading *American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company* by Bryce Hoffman.
I seem to be drawn to books that cover various periods in business.  Like *Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story* by Kurt Eichenwald and other similar titles.

I've begun my latest class through [Fort Hays State University][2]{:target="_blank"}, which is [IDS 401: Ethical Issues in the Professions and Business][5]{:target="_blank"}.

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my pretentious email address - <lee@madajczyk.com>.

The addition of this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3]{:target="_blank"}.  This was last updated on June 6, 2017.
