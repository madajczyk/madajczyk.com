I live just outside of Green Bay, WI.  I work for [Humana][1], in their Information Technology department, as I have for the past handful of years.  Previously, I worked for a large regional bank.  I loved working there, but that love wasn't reciprocated.

I'm continuing to work on updating this website, as I haven't really paid much attention to it over the last couple of years.  You can see updates via the [GitHub repository][4].

I really enjoy reading.  I just finished reading [*We Have Lost the Pelicans*][6] by Paul Mathews.
A funny look at British political satire; it's the second of the series.  I believe the third will be coming out soon.

I've begun my latest class through [Fort Hays State University][2], which is [IDS 401: Ethical Issues in the Professions and Business][5].

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my pretentious email address - <lee@madajczyk.com>.
