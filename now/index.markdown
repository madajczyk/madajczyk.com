I find myself living (again!) just outside of Green Bay, WI.  I work for an insurance company, that you've probably heard of, in the Information Technology department.  I have been employed there for the past handful of years.  Previously, I worked for a large regional bank that you most likely haven't heard of.  I loved working there, but it seems that my love wasn't reciprocated.

I'm continuing to work on updating this website, as I haven't really paid much attention to it over the last couple of years.  You can the [GitHub repository][4], and can see [updates here][5].  Just don't look too closely.  I'm not really good at this.

I really enjoy reading.  I recently finished reading something or other, but darned
if I can remember what it was.  I've been consumed lately by podcasts, so I'm finding
it harder and harder to find time to read.

I've just complete the latest class I enrolled in via [Fort Hays State University][2],
which was [IDS 401: Ethical Issues in the Professions and Business][6].

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my pretentious email address - <lee@madajczyk.com>.

The addition of this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3].  This was last updated on August 1st, 2017.
