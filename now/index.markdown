Finished the winter semester at [Fort Hays State University][1] a few weeks ago.  Still feeling
burned out, but realized that I'm not that far from earning my [BGS][2] degree, so ~~I guess I'll
power through it.~~ Nope!  Dropped classes because I realized I truly am burned out.

Got back from Kauai about a week ago.  It's amazing and awesome and beautiful and
so much better than Wisconsin Death Trip ice and snow and stuff.  If I can find
a way to move there, I think I might do it.

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Feel free to send a message to
my (probably) pretentious email address:
