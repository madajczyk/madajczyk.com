I find myself living just outside of Green Bay, WI.  I work for an insurance company, that you've probably heard of, in the Information Technology department.  I have been employed there for the past handful of years.  Previously, I worked for a large regional bank that you most likely haven't heard of.  I loved working there, but it seems that my love wasn't reciprocated.

I'm continuing to work on updating this website, as I haven't really paid much attention to it over the last couple of years.  You can the [GitHub repository][4], and can see [updates here][5].  Just don't look too closely.  I'm not really good at this.

I really enjoy reading.  I recently finished reading [*Passenger 19*][7] by Ward
Larsen.  Gripping, exciting, if not a little predictable.  Still enjoyed it.

I'm about 2/3 of the way though the latest class I'm taking through [Fort Hays State University][2],
which is [IDS 401: Ethical Issues in the Professions and Business][6].

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my pretentious email address - <lee@madajczyk.com>.

The addition of this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3].  This was last updated on July 3, 2017.
