## What I'm doing now:

I live just outside of Green Bay, WI.  I work for [Humana][1], in their Information Technology department, as I have for the past handful of years.

I'm trying to get this website back up and humming, as I haven't really paid much attention to it over the last couple of years.

I really enjoy reading.  I just finished reading *American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company* by Bryce Hoffman.
I seem to be drawn to books that cover various periods in business.  Like *Conspiracy of Fools: A True Story* by Kurt Eichenwald and other similar titles.

I've started taking classes through [Fort Hays State University][2] again, and am enrolled in another class for the summer semester.

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my pretentious email address - lee@madajczyk.com.

The addition of this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3], and I last updated it in May of 2017.
