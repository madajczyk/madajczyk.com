I find myself living (again!) just outside of Green Bay, WI.  I work in the IT
department for an insurance company that you've probably heard of.  I have been
employed there for the past handful of years.  Previously, I worked for a large
regional bank that you most likely haven't heard of.  I loved working there,
but it seems that my love wasn't reciprocated.

I'm continuing to work on updating this website, as I haven't really paid much
attention to it over the last couple of years.  You can see the updates in the 
[GitHub repository][3].  Just don't look too
closely.  I'm not really good at this.

I really enjoy reading.  I recently finished reading something or other, but
darned if I can remember what it was.  I've been consumed lately by podcasts, so
I'm finding it harder and harder to find time to read.  I should consume the
Goodreads feed in a better way, but right now, here's the [raw view][4].

The next semester has started at [Fort Hays State University][1], and I'm trying
to take 9 credits this time.  This might be too much, we'll see how it goes.

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my
pretentious email address - <lee@madajczyk.com>.

The addition of this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][2].  This was last
