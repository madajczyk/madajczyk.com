I'm just wrapping up a decently long vacation, and will be returning to work
tomorrow.  With the holiday celebrations, the first part of the vacation was
a little hectic, but that's probably to be expected.

I finished reading True Faith and Allegiance from Mark Greaney, which is an
extension of the [Ryanverse][3] even though the book isn't listed.

For a good portion of the vacation, I purposely stayed away from the keyboard,
but I've spent the last few days trying to get back into the swing of things. I
did some work on the [Raspberry Pi][4], and I'm really enjoying the platform.

I am definitely still enjoying the winter break from [Fort Hays State University][1],
and finished up another semester a few weeks ago.  I'm now about one-third of
the way done with the credits for this go-around.

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my
pretentious email address - <lee@madajczyk.com>.

The addition of this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][2].  I last updated
it on Monday, January 1st, 2018.
