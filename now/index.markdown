    Great idea!  I've last updated it on {{ "now" | date: "%A, %d %B %Y" }}

Lots of changes here on the site, although hardly anybody will notice..  Completely
revamped the format, using a new template I built based on [Bulma][3]. Finally
implemented a number of features I've been meaning to add, including an improved
[search][4] courtesy of [Algolia][5].

Almost halfway through the semester at [Fort Hays State University][1].  I'm taking
nine more credits, which I think I finally am starting to get dialed in on.  When I
finish, I should be about halfway through the [BGS][2] degree program.  Woot!

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Feel free to send a message to
my (probably) pretentious email address:
