Back to work.

During my break, I was able to finally get caught up with Season 3 of Netflix's
excellent show [Narcos][5].  I also  found some time to do some digging into
[MongoDB][6], as well as start heading down one of the learning paths offered via
[Microsoft's AI School][7].

I've started up the next semester at [Fort Hays State University][1].  I'm taking
nine more credits, and I should be about halfway done once I get through with it.

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my
pretentious email address - <lee@madajczyk.com>.

The addition of this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][2].  I last updated
it on Monday, January 24th, 2018.
