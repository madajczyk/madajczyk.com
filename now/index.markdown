I live just outside of Green Bay, WI.  I work for [Humana][1], in the Information Technology department, as I have for the past handful of years.  Previously, I worked for a large regional bank.  I loved working there, but that love wasn't reciprocated.

I'm continuing to work on updating this website, as I haven't really paid much attention to it over the last couple of years.  You can the [GitHub repository][4], and can see [updates here][5].

I really enjoy reading.  I just finished reading [*We Have Lost the Pelicans*][6] by Paul Mathews.
A funny look at British political satire; it's the second of the series.  I believe the third will be coming out soon.

I'm about 1/3 of the way though the latest class I'm taking through [Fort Hays State University][2], which is
[IDS 401: Ethical Issues in the Professions and Business][5].

If you'd like to reach out, I'd love to hear from you.  Send a message to my pretentious email address - <lee@madajczyk.com>.

The addition of this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3].  This was last updated on July 3, 2017.
